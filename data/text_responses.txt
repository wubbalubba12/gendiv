=== Can you briefly explain your answer above? (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [unspecified] ===
- Mostly prefer in person classes
- went to classes at university again, met peers
- I always was a remote learner as driving 2 hours everyday for most of the times just one or two courses is a bif waste of time. So at the pandemic uni was much more suited for my learning style. After uni I still do most of the things at home, but now the time wasting driving is back.
- I learned how to work alone at home, and after the pandemic it stayed that way. I did not go back to the study style I had before the pandemic.
- Still a lot of remote work. Also, not moving to Darmstadt during the pandemic lead to me now commuting most of my Masters time
- resumed in-person lectures
- I switched to hybrid
- Returning to structured university settings helped me
- I now do more self learning

=== What kind of support would have helped you better during the pandemic? (Question inspired by Beutel et al. (2021), Hohne et al. (2022)) (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [unspecified] ===
- more chances to meet peers and connect
- More connection to other students. Discors is fine but very anonymous and too public. Having something like zoom meetings with group separation based on common courses or something would have been nice. But I had lots of chats with friends instead.
- Being able to study together instead of alone
- literally any support, TU Darmstadt provides/provided literally nothing, on the contrary they made Uni life actively worse and it's still way worse than compared to e.g. Goethe Uni
- Psychological counseling
- More mental health days
- interactive online office hours
- Personalized feedback
- Studies wise support

- not good
- fine but in academic context a bit lonely and isolated
- In the beginning it was a bit concerning, but after getring used to it, it was nice that everyone had time, wanted to connect, we were doing lots outside and had great summers. So from the private side it was really a blessing and after breaking up with my ex, there was much less stress, so it was a very good time for me.
- I was very tired, unmotivated.
- Catastrophic, I literally had to go to therapy
- emtionally drained some weeks
- Poor
