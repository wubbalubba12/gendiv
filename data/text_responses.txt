=== This is a survey on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate computer science students, with a focus on well-being, productivity, and study practices. The purpose of this study is to understand how students adapted during different phases of the pandemic and how these experiences continue to shape their academic and mental health outcomes today. Participation in this survey is entirely voluntary, and you may skip any question or withdraw at any point. It would help us a lot if you could complete all the fields. The survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Your responses will remain anonymous and confidential, and all data will be used solely for research purposes. No personally identifying information will be collected. This study is being conducted by Juliane Bechert and Nikhil Sai Pothakamuri, undergraduate students at TU Darmstadt. If you have any questions about the study or your rights as a participant, please contact: Juliane Bechert – juliane.bechert@stud.tu-darmstadt.de Nikhil Sai Pothakamuri – nikhil.pothakamuri@stud.tu-darmstadt.de By clicking “Yes” below, you confirm that: - You are 18 years of age or older, - You have read and understood the information provided, - You voluntarily agree to participate in this study. ===

=== This is a survey on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate computer science students, with a focus on well-being, productivity, and study practices. The purpose of this study is to understand how students adapted during different phases of the pandemic and how these experiences continue to shape their academic and mental health outcomes today. Participation in this survey is entirely voluntary, and you may skip any question or withdraw at any point. It would help us a lot if you could complete all the fields. The survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Your responses will remain anonymous and confidential, and all data will be used solely for research purposes. No personally identifying information will be collected. This study is being conducted by Juliane Bechert and Nikhil Sai Pothakamuri, undergraduate students at TU Darmstadt. If you have any questions about the study or your rights as a participant, please contact: Juliane Bechert – juliane.bechert@stud.tu-darmstadt.de Nikhil Sai Pothakamuri – nikhil.pothakamuri@stud.tu-darmstadt.de By clicking “Yes” below, you confirm that: - You are 18 years of age or older, - You have read and understood the information provided, - You voluntarily agree to participate in this study. ===

=== This is a survey on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate computer science students, with a focus on well-being, productivity, and study practices. The purpose of this study is to understand how students adapted during different phases of the pandemic and how these experiences continue to shape their academic and mental health outcomes today. Participation in this survey is entirely voluntary, and you may skip any question or withdraw at any point. It would help us a lot if you could complete all the fields. The survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Your responses will remain anonymous and confidential, and all data will be used solely for research purposes. No personally identifying information will be collected. This study is being conducted by Juliane Bechert and Nikhil Sai Pothakamuri, undergraduate students at TU Darmstadt. If you have any questions about the study or your rights as a participant, please contact: Juliane Bechert – juliane.bechert@stud.tu-darmstadt.de Nikhil Sai Pothakamuri – nikhil.pothakamuri@stud.tu-darmstadt.de By clicking “Yes” below, you confirm that: - You are 18 years of age or older, - You have read and understood the information provided, - You voluntarily agree to participate in this study. ===
