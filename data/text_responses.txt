- Isolation
- Lack of structure
- Concentrating
- It actually was pretty easy to me

- No

=== Can you briefly explain your answer above? (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [yes/no] ===
- Mostly prefer in person classes
- went to classes at university again, met peers
- I always was a remote learner as driving 2 hours everyday for most of the times just one or two courses is a bif waste of time. So at the pandemic uni was much more suited for my learning style. After uni I still do most of the things at home, but now the time wasting driving is back.
- I learned how to work alone at home, and after the pandemic it stayed that way. I did not go back to the study style I had before the pandemic.
- Still a lot of remote work. Also, not moving to Darmstadt during the pandemic lead to me now commuting most of my Masters time
- resumed in-person lectures
- I switched to hybrid
- Returning to structured university settings helped me
- I now do more self learning
- I tried to study remote as much as possible since it works better for me
- A lot of my work is still remote and I still watch recordings of lectures a lot instead of going in person
- Because of a depression I continued to study and work remotely
- not the 100%
- I found new friends and had a lot of fun, even though many options in life got less( like life or partys)
- Uni didn't offer much for a long time more
- I did return by getting my productivity back, but my style changed completely. I've become a workaholic. So far, it's been going good, but I'm afraid I might burn out at some point. Altough I'm worried, I don't want to drop anything, because I just for some reason want to do as much as possible.
- the main thing that changes was not studying together in discord and explain each other the topics talking to a scree, instead in person. but the main style did not change at all.
- Corona never really went away, I still wear a mask in public transport, when shopping, ...
- meet friends in person, doing sports together and learn for studies
- Became more aware of the importance of activities like walking or working out
- i keept learning many things remote, because i felt confident in learning this way
- I started studying at the beginning of the Pandemic, so all my learning habits in university were (unfortunately) developed during Covid. And adopting old habits from school would not have worked due to different environment.
- It took several more semester until I was back at university properly and regularly to do my Master's
- Even after restrictions were lifted, I found it difficult to return to any structured or productive study style — I felt like I was still catching up for a long time

=== What kind of support would have helped you better during the pandemic? (Question inspired by Beutel et al. (2021), Hohne et al. (2022)) (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [yes/no] ===
- more chances to meet peers and connect
- More connection to other students. Discors is fine but very anonymous and too public. Having something like zoom meetings with group separation based on common courses or something would have been nice. But I had lots of chats with friends instead.
- Being able to study together instead of alone
- literally any support, TU Darmstadt provides/provided literally nothing, on the contrary they made Uni life actively worse and it's still way worse than compared to e.g. Goethe Uni
- Psychological counseling
- More mental health days
- interactive online office hours
- Personalized feedback
- Studies wise support
- it worked quite well for me
- more gatherings (remote or in person) with other students, councelling
- to provide more consultation hours
- Social contacts even without the university contacts
- Keeping contact with my peers, but I don't think online contact would have helped much. Maybe getting more mental health support from university.
- more Zoom Sessions for asking questions
- Being new to university, I wasn't used to organizational aspects at all, and I feel there was insufficient online guidance that explained these things in simple terms.
- support in peer communication
- More outreach and communication/interaction with other students. The actual classes themselves were mostly fine in remote style, but the lack of peers to easily build connection and study groups were a major hindrance.
- Nothing

=== Looking back, how would you describe your overall well-being during 2020–2022? (Question adapted from Beutel et al. (2021)) (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [yes/no] ===
- not good
- fine but in academic context a bit lonely and isolated
- In the beginning it was a bit concerning, but after getring used to it, it was nice that everyone had time, wanted to connect, we were doing lots outside and had great summers. So from the private side it was really a blessing and after breaking up with my ex, there was much less stress, so it was a very good time for me.
- I was very tired, unmotivated.
- Catastrophic, I literally had to go to therapy
- emtionally drained some weeks
- Poor
- Emotionally unstable
- isolation, poor sleep, and loss of academic direction
- Goated
- Well.
- I was going through a lot of changes as a person so my well-being was very up and down. But it also helped me disconnect from busy work and studies which allowed me to use that time like a "break"
- Not very well
- im happy becouse covid was not an fun think many people risks there life and i am lucky to say that i got the chance to stay at home and dont need to work on a hospital or something
- In the beginning Bad but I had it better than others  since I did not live alone.
- Massively downhill riding
- Not good, I was stressed, I procrastinated, my social life was dire and I did even know why I was studyinig.
- okay, managed it alright because social deficits would party be compensated with long phone calls
- baaaaad
- I think it was quiet good, but I had some periods followed by stress
- I liked being at home, which made me feel more psychologically comfortable, but I lacked physical activity.
- not too got
- Not well or bad but they had a lasting negative impact on my academic habits and success.
- All in all good, but stagnation in studies
- It was probably the worst period for me, as every single day was filled with stress

=== What new habits or routines did you form during the pandemic? (Question inspired by Russo et al. (2021)) (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [yes/no] ===
- calling people when I walk the dog, more self care, sleeping 8h no matter how much tasks there are left
- No
- journaling
- Online notetaking
- Using Discord for study groups
- calendar planning
- Coding after midnight
- Eating
- getting up more early, using discord
- Remote work and lectures and learning more on my own
- music, sport
- Don’t know …
- Being able to live with an average of 2-3h sleep/d
- During the pandamic I was mostly lazy, so I did not develop good new habits. Since the end of the pandamic I've become very work-focused.
- running to clear my mind
- A new addiction c:
- doing exercises by myself
- Walking and waking up late
- Most every of my learning habits were formed during the pandemic.
- sleep long and exercise in the evening or at night
- Nothing

=== Can you expand on why or why not from the previous question? (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [yes/no] ===
- I still call people when walking the dog
- help me stay organized
- I dropped them once I got back
- improved my productivit
- help me manage stress
- using discord a lot
- i study more alone when i feel like i can be more productive that way
- Work overload
- I did not continue any habits because my style totally changed since then.
- the running to clear my find as I find it very effective to be balanced
- It helped me to look at things on my own, and I was sometimes more productive than at university with many friends around. I took a lot of time to study by myself.
- I kept doing it because I liked how walking made my mind feel clear and relaxed
- Mostly because they're just what I know, but also because breaking habits and making new (better) ones is hard.
- On-site dates with travel times make getting up late no longer so easy

=== Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience during the pandemic? (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [yes/no] ===
- Students were left alone, still are
Support from TUD was/is abysmal
Organization and workload was/is very bad
- pandemic made me more independent
- Goated
- No
- No.
- Starting university during the pandemic had a pretty bad impact on my academic success, and I'm likely never going to 'make up' for those years. They also had a lasting impact on my habits having made it difficult to get into better ones afterwards.
- Was a though but also interesting time
- I don’t have anything particularly special to share, but I actually started my very first semester during the pandemic. My first two semesters were fully online, and because the starts went so poorly, as international student I struggled to catch up with university for almost two years. I'm not exactly sure why it took me so long to recover..
