=== After restrictions eased, did you return to your pre-pandemic work/study style?
Can you briefly explain your answer above? (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [unspecified] ===
- I started studying at the beginning of the Pandemic, so all my learning habits in university were (unfortunately) developed during Covid. And adopting old habits from school would not have worked due to different environment.
- I switched to hybrid
- went to classes at university again, met peers
- It took several more semester until I was back at university properly and regularly to do my Master's
- Still a lot of remote work. Also, not moving to Darmstadt during the pandemic lead to me now commuting most of my Masters time
- I found new friends and had a lot of fun, even though many options in life got less( like life or partys)
- I now do more self learning
- Because of a depression I continued to study and work remotely
- I did return by getting my productivity back, but my style changed completely. I've become a workaholic. So far, it's been going good, but I'm afraid I might burn out at some point. Altough I'm worried, I don't want to drop anything, because I just for some reason want to do as much as possible.
- I tried to study remote as much as possible since it works better for me
- I used to do more self-study and research, and stayed with this ahead. Sometimes opt online meetings avoiding certain travel time and collaborating on projects and communication at both work and study online. - More, individual studying made things interesting for me and reduced dependency on the university. Watching recorded lectures was the best part.
- the main thing that changes was not studying together in discord and explain each other the topics talking to a scree, instead in person. but the main style did not change at all.
- Even after restrictions were lifted, I found it difficult to return to any structured or productive study style — I felt like I was still catching up for a long time
- not the 100%
- resumed in-person lectures
- A lot of my work is still remote and I still watch recordings of lectures a lot instead of going in person
- I always was a remote learner as driving 2 hours everyday for most of the times just one or two courses is a bif waste of time. So at the pandemic uni was much more suited for my learning style. After uni I still do most of the things at home, but now the time wasting driving is back.
- Became more aware of the importance of activities like walking or working out
- Returning to structured university settings helped me
- i keept learning many things remote, because i felt confident in learning this way
- I learned how to work alone at home, and after the pandemic it stayed that way. I did not go back to the study style I had before the pandemic.
- Mostly prefer in person classes
- Corona never really went away, I still wear a mask in public transport, when shopping, ...
- Uni didn't offer much for a long time more
- meet friends in person, doing sports together and learn for studies

=== What kind of support would have helped you better during the pandemic? (Question inspired by Beutel et al. (2021), Hohne et al. (2022)) (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [unspecified] ===
- More outreach and communication/interaction with other students. The actual classes themselves were mostly fine in remote style, but the lack of peers to easily build connection and study groups were a major hindrance.
- Psychological counseling
- more chances to meet peers and connect
- literally any support, TU Darmstadt provides/provided literally nothing, on the contrary they made Uni life actively worse and it's still way worse than compared to e.g. Goethe Uni
- Social contacts even without the university contacts
- Keeping contact with my peers, but I don't think online contact would have helped much. Maybe getting more mental health support from university.
- it worked quite well for me
- More mental health days
- some financial ease and aids would've been better
- interactive online office hours
- Nothing
- to provide more consultation hours
- Studies wise support
- more gatherings (remote or in person) with other students, councelling
- More connection to other students. Discors is fine but very anonymous and too public. Having something like zoom meetings with group separation based on common courses or something would have been nice. But I - had lots of chats with friends instead.
- Being new to university, I wasn't used to organizational aspects at all, and I feel there was insufficient online guidance that explained these things in simple terms.
- Personalized feedback
- support in peer communication
- Being able to study together instead of alone
- more Zoom Sessions for asking questions

=== Looking back, how would you describe your overall well-being during 2020–2022? (Question adapted from Beutel et al. (2021)) (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [unspecified] ===
- Not well or bad but they had a lasting negative impact on my academic habits and success.
- Poor
- fine but in academic context a bit lonely and isolated
- All in all good, but stagnation in studies
- Catastrophic, I literally had to go to therapy
- In the beginning Bad but I had it better than others since I did not live alone.
- Not very well
- Not good, I was stressed, I procrastinated, my social life was dire and I did even know why I was studyinig.
- Well.
- It was fine, mentally disturbing but helped me discover other side of my life. I started appreciating things and my life more than ever. I was thankful for small things as well. I started putting weight to values in life along materialistic things.
- okay, managed it alright because social deficits would party be compensated with long phone calls
- Emotionally unstable
- It was probably the worst period for me, as every single day was filled with stress
- im happy becouse covid was not an fun think many people risks there life and i am lucky to say that i got the chance to stay at home and dont need to work on a hospital or something
emtionally drained some weeks
- Goated
- I was going through a lot of changes as a person so my well-being was very up and down. But it also helped me disconnect from busy work and studies which allowed me to use that time like a "break"
- In the beginning it was a bit concerning, but after getring used to it, it was nice that everyone had time, wanted to connect, we were doing lots outside and had great summers. So from the private side it was really a blessing and after breaking up with my ex, there was much less stress, so it was a very good time for me.
- I liked being at home, which made me feel more psychologically comfortable, but I lacked physical activity.
- isolation, poor sleep, and loss of academic direction
- not too got
- I was very tired, unmotivated.
- not good
- baaaaad
- Massively downhill riding
- I think it was quiet good, but I had some periods followed by stress

=== What new habits or routines did you form during the pandemic? (Question inspired by Russo et al. (2021)) (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [unspecified] ===
- Most every of my learning habits were formed during the pandemic.
- Online notetaking
- sleep long and exercise in the evening or at night
- No
- Don’t know …
- Coding after midnight
- During the pandamic I was mostly lazy, so I did not develop good new habits. Since the end of the pandamic I've become very work-focused.
- getting up more early, using discord
- Studying online, fact checking related to any info, online meetings, more sharing of news and data with friends and families
- running to clear my mind
- Using Discord for study groups
- Nothing
- music, sport
- journaling
- Eating
- Remote work and lectures and learning more on my own
- calling people when I walk the dog, more self care, sleeping 8h no matter how much tasks there are left
- Walking and waking up late
- calendar planning
- A new addiction c:
- Being able to live with an average of 2-3h sleep/d
- doing exercises by myself

=== Have you continued any of those habits after returning to in-person or hybrid formats?
Can you expand on why or why not from the previous question? (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [unspecified] ===
- Mostly because they're just what I know, but also because breaking habits and making new (better) ones is hard.
- I dropped them once I got back
- On-site dates with travel times make getting up late no longer so easy
- I did not continue any habits because my style totally changed since then.
- using discord a lot
- As mentioned earlier, I saw some positivities in online meetings, collaborations and studying from the internet and self-learning effectively
- the running to clear my find as I find it very effective to be balanced
- improved my productivit
- help me stay organized
- i study more alone when i feel like i can be more productive that way
- I still call people when walking the dog
- I kept doing it because I liked how walking made my mind feel clear and relaxed
- help me manage stress
- Work overload
- It helped me to look at things on my own, and I was sometimes more productive than at university with many friends around. I took a lot of time to study by myself.

=== Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience during the pandemic? (You can answer in full sentences or bullet points – whichever is easier for you.) [unspecified] ===
- Starting university during the pandemic had a pretty bad impact on my academic success, and I'm likely never going to 'make up' for those years. They also had a lasting impact on my habits having made it difficult to get into better ones afterwards.
- Was a though but also interesting time
- Students were left alone, still are
- Support from TUD was/is abysmal
- Organization and workload was/is very bad
- No.
- It was not at all easy; as computer science students we already study and work on the computers, staying social and mental also needed online tools and help. This was physically exhausting, which in turn result in mental and emotional stress. It took the most motivation and focus out of my whole life.
- I don’t have anything particularly special to share, but I actually started my very first semester during the pandemic. My first two semesters were fully online, and because the starts went so poorly, as international student I struggled to catch up with university for almost two years. I'm not exactly sure why it took me so long to recover..
- Goated
- pandemic made me more independent
- No
