# 📊 COVID-19 Student Survey Analysis

This project analyzes survey responses from computer science students regarding their academic experiences, mental health, and productivity **before**, **during**, and **after the COVID-19 pandemic**.

It supports:
- 🟦 Likert-scale analysis (e.g., "Strongly Agree" → numeric)
- 🟨 Categorical distribution visualization
- 🟩 Open-ended text extraction (from questions like "Please describe...")
- 🗂️ Handling of repeated questions across timeframes (before/during/after)

## 🧠 Key Features

- Automatically deduplicates repeated survey questions
- Recognizes Likert-style responses (e.g., "1 - Never", "5 - Strongly agree")
- Detects text questions based on their **instructions** in the question text (e.g., “You can answer in full sentences...”)
- Creates visualizations using `seaborn` and saves them to `plots/`
- Exports all text-based responses into a human-readable `.txt` file
