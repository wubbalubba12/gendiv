# 📊 COVID-19 Student Survey Analysis

This project analyzes survey responses from computer science students regarding their academic experiences, mental health, and productivity **before**, **during**, and **after the COVID-19 pandemic**.

It supports:

- 🟦 Likert-scale analysis and normalization (e.g., `"1 - Never"` → `1`)
- 🟨 Yes/No categorical data parsing
- 🟩 Open-text response extraction and export
- 🕒 Handling of repeated questions across multiple timeframes (before/during/after)
- 📈 Optional visualization (plots saved to disk)

## 🧠 Key Features

- Automatically deduplicates repeated survey questions
- Recognizes Likert-style responses (e.g., "1 - Never", "5 - Strongly agree")
- Detects text questions based on their **instructions** in the question text (e.g., “You can answer in full sentences...”)
- Creates visualizations using `seaborn` and saves them to `plots/`
- Exports all text-based responses into a human-readable `.txt` file
